# verisolv

A numerical ODE/PDE solver whose core is **implemented, accelerated, and
formally verified**. The same explicit-Euler recurrence
`y_{k+1} = y_k + h·f(t_k, y_k)` appears in production Python
(`solver/methods/euler.py`), in an optional Rust kernel that speeds up the
higher-order Runge–Kutta methods, and in a machine-checked Lean 4 proof that the
method converges at `O(h)`. The Python package gives you a SciPy-like
`solve_ivp` with five ODE integrators (Euler, RK4, Dormand–Prince RK45,
Adams–Bashforth 4, BDF) and two 1-D PDE solvers (heat, wave) — all deterministic,
stability-aware, and validated against analytic solutions and SciPy.

## Prerequisites

- **Python ≥ 3.10** with `pip` and `venv`. The core depends on **numpy** and
  **scipy** (installed automatically below).
- **Rust toolchain** (`cargo`, stable) — only for the optional accelerated kernel
  in step 3. Install via [rustup](https://rustup.rs).
- **elan / Lean 4** — only for the formal proof in step 4. Install via
  [elan](https://github.com/leanprover/elan); `lake` ships with the toolchain and
  fetches Mathlib on first build.

Steps 1–2 give a fully working solver. Steps 3 and 4 are optional and light up
the Rust fast path and the Lean proof respectively.

## Build & test

The artifact builds and validates with **four commands** — `pip install`,
`pytest`, `cargo test`, and `lake build` — plus an optional fifth step that
builds the Rust accelerator.

**1. Create the environment and install the package (editable, with dev + bench extras):**

```bash
python -m venv .venv && . .venv/bin/activate && pip install -e ".[dev,bench]"
```

**2. Run the Python test suite:**

```bash
pytest
```

**3. Test the Rust kernels (no Python interpreter needed):**

```bash
cd rust_core && cargo test
```

**4. Build and check the Lean proof:**

```bash
cd lean && lake exe cache get && lake build
```

`lake exe cache get` downloads Mathlib's prebuilt `.olean` cache so only
`ODE/EulerConvergence.lean` is compiled locally (skipping it forces a multi-hour
from-source Mathlib build). `lake build` then checks `ODE/EulerConvergence.lean`
— the formal `O(h)` convergence theorem for the Euler recurrence used in
`solver/methods/euler.py` — and runs `#print axioms`, which reports dependence
only on `propext`, `Classical.choice`, and `Quot.sound` (the proof-hole axiom
`sorryAx` is absent).

**5. (Optional) Build the Rust accelerator and re-run the tests to exercise it:**

```bash
cd rust_core && maturin develop --release
pytest   # from the repo root
```

After this, `RUST_AVAILABLE` is `True`, `solve_ivp(..., use_rust=True)` routes
`rk4`/`rk45` through the compiled kernel, and re-running `pytest` additionally
checks that the Rust and Python `rk4` results agree bit-for-bit.

**6. (Optional) Build the browser-native WASM solver:**

```bash
cd wasm_solver && wasm-pack build --target web --out-dir pkg --release
```

The generated `pkg/` exposes a `wasm-bindgen` `OdeSystem` class. It parses ODE
right-hand-side expressions once, then runs RK4 steps inside WebAssembly using
the pure Rust verisolv kernel, so browser apps do not need a Python extension or
a per-derivative JavaScript callback.

## Quick start

```python
import numpy as np
from solver import solve_ivp

# y' = -y, y(0) = 1  ->  exact y(t) = exp(-t)
res = solve_ivp(lambda t, y: -y, (0.0, 5.0), 1.0, method="rk45")
print(res.y_final, np.exp(-5.0))   # ~ agree to tolerance
```

## Benchmarks

`benchmarks/compare_scipy.py` compares our `rk45` (and `rk4`, optionally the Rust
path) against `scipy.integrate.solve_ivp` on exponential decay, the harmonic
oscillator, Lotka–Volterra, and a stiff problem, writing `benchmarks/results.csv`
(and PNGs if matplotlib is present):

```bash
python benchmarks/compare_scipy.py
```
